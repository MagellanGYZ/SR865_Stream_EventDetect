# SR865_Stream_EventDetect

This project is still in progress.

This program objective is to stream data from the Lock-in Amplifier SR865A (product of Stanford Research System), and detect the expected event (like a pulse). The streaming part was modified from the official code (you can find it here https://github.com/BobBaylor/stream), make sure you've read that. So if you just need to capture data from a set duration, use that program is ok.

Another module you need to install is PySide2, I want to make a gui to start or stop our detection easily.
